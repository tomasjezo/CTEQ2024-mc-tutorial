# CTEQ2024 Monte Carlo Tutorial, August 2024

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce essential tools for making predictions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Through a series of simple examples, you will learn the basics of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, including how to generate events, store them, and analyse the results using a standard analysis toolchain. 

## Lecture 1 - Thursday, 22.08.2024

After a brief recap on the purpose and basic components of MC event generators, we will introduce an essential technical prerequisite: `Docker`. Since installing the software required for this tutorial can be challenging and time-consuming, we have prepared a `Docker` image that includes all the necessary prerequisites and can be easily downloaded onto any computer capable of running `Docker`. Notes on how to obtain the image and work with it can be found here. At the end, we will verify that everyone can use the image and provide assistance to those who experience difficulties.

## Hands-on session 1 - Friday, 23.08.2024

The learning materials for this session can be found [here](session1_examples.md). This document contains basic instructions along with several examples. We will go through the material together; the examples will be discussed first and then demonstrated. You're expected to try the examples right away, but don't worry if you fall behind. We've allocated plenty of time for everyone to work through the exercises in tomorrow's session.

## Lecture 2 - Sunday, 25.08.2024




## Hands-on session 2 - Sunday, 25.08.2024

## Independent work

Your experience may vary significantly, and for those of you with extensive experience, weâ€™ve also prepared a simple [assignment](assignment.md). You can work on it independently.
